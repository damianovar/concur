consider moreover that it is logical to consider the program graph as a "learning model", i.e., something that says "if you learn this then you will remember better this". Note that however one may also have individualized models learned through data-driven approaches (and here the "big data" framework is behind the door)

consider moreover that proposing exercises corresponds to actuate the memory (and thus increase the field)

given the estimated state and the "learning model", something interesting is to create individualized suggestions on what to study in a way that maximizes the results (i.e., increasing the field where needed) while minimizing the efforts (i.e., avoid repeating concepts for which there is no necessity for studying because that person knows them)
