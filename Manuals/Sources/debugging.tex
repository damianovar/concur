\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Be sure that each \texttt{.xlsx} has 24 rows in the 'course summary tab', and that the last two rows are 'course starting date' and 'course ending date';

	\item put a zero in the A1 cell of the non-first-sheet of the various \ac{KCM} files. This serves as an ``anchor'' for Matlab;

	\item each column in the program definition file has to be separated by \textbf{one} tab (see Section~\ref{creating_the_database}).

\end{itemize}
