\begin{itemize}

\item Be sure that each \texttt{.xlsx} has 24 rows in the 'course
	summary tab', and that the last two rows are 'course
	starting date' and 'course ending date'.

\item The A1 cell of all sheets but the first in the
	\ac{KCM} files should contain a number. This serves as an
	``anchor'' for Matlab's \texttt{importdata} function.
	% We should do something about Matlab automatically determining
	% the range...

\item Each column in the program definition file must be separated
	by exactly one tab (see Section~\ref{creating_the_database}).

\end{itemize}
