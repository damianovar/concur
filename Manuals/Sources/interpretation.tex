	\item[out degree:] when considering a course, a high out-degree indicates that this course exposes students to \acp{KC} that are likely being introductory or instrumental to build a framework later on. This means that assessments in courses that have high out degrees correspond to "baseline assessments", i.e., evaluations of students' initial knowledge. Similar concepts apply to a \ac{KC}: a high out degree would imply that this \acp{KC} likely represents baseline knowledge;

	\item[in degree:] when considering a course, a high in-degree indicates that this course is the destination of the learning efforts. From a pedagogical perspective this indirectly indicates courses where it is important to engage students with active and higher-level learning activities. Assessments on these courses are a sort of "final assessments" for the program. Similar concepts apply to a \ac{KC};

	\item[betweenness:] when considering a course, a high betweenness indicates that this course serves as a key link between different clusters of courses or \acp{KC} in a program. This indicates that they serve as a bridge; for this reason assessments on courses with high betweenness serve both the purposes described above, i.e., as evaluations of students' initial knowledge for the next "cluster" of courses, and of students final knowledge for the previous "cluster" of courses. Similar concepts apply to a \ac{KC};

	\item[eigenvector centrality:] in graph theory, the eigenvector centrality measures the influence of a node in a network in a similar way that the Google pagerank algorithm works: if a node is pointed to by many nodes which also have high eigenvector centrality then that node will have high eigenvector centrality. In a sense, the links of a node with higher eigenvector centrality are more influential than the links of a node with a lower centrality index. When considering a course, an interpretation of this index is in terms of "how much this course serves as a support and reinforcement for other courses". Assessments on courses with high eigenvector centrality indexes serve as complementary assessments for other courses;

% 	\item[clustering coefficient:] Vectors with a high clustering coefficient are the ones most likely to efficiently enact change to the adjacent vectors. The clustering coefficient is useful in finding the course that can most efficiently implement change into adjacent courses. This is relevant because all assessment schemes require a feedback mechanism to modify the curriculum when the assessment data indicate a problem. The quicker this change can be incorporated into the curriculum, the sooner improved results will (hopefully) occur. Those courses with the highest clustering coefficient are the ones best suited for quick, efficient implementation.
