% \textbf{Title: Work and Energy 5}

Three bicycles approach a hill as described below:

I: Cyclist 1 stops pedaling at the bottom of the hill, and the bicycle coasts up the hill.

II: Cyclist 2 pedals so that the bicycle goes up the hill at a constant speed.

III: Cyclist 3 pedals harder, so that the bicycle goes up the hill at a constant acceleration.

Ignoring the retarding effects of friction and air resistance, select all cases in which the total mechanical energy of the cyclist and bicycle is conserved, i.e. the total mechanical energy is constant. \\
