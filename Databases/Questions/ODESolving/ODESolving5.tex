% \textbf{Title: ODE solving: Par. 1}

A set of nonhomogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients has the nonhomogeneous term \( f ( x ) = \cos x \). With \(D = \frac{d}{dx} \), in which equation does the particular solution not include \( kf ( x ) \), where \( k \neq 0 \) is a constant? \\


a. \( ( D^{2} + 4 )y = f ( x ) \)

*b. \( ( D^{2} + 2D + 1 ) y = f ( x ) \)

c. \( ( D + 1  ) y = f ( x ) \)

d. \( ( D^{2} - 1 ) y = f(x) \)

e. I do not know. \\
