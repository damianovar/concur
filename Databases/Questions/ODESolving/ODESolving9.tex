% \textbf{Title: ODE solving: CC 3}

The characteristic equation of a linear and homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients has three roots at \( \lambda = a \), two complex conjugate roots at \( \lambda = b \pm ci \) and one root at \( \lambda = d \). Which of these suggested solutions is the best description of the homogeneous solution? \\


a. \( y = e^{ax} + e^{bx}\cos cx - e^{bx}\sin cx + e^{dx} \).

b. \( y = ( 1 + x )e^{ax} + e^{bx}\cos ( cx + \phi ) - e^{dx} \).

*c. \( y = ( C_{1}x^{2} + C_{2}x + C_{3} )e^{ax} + C_{4}e^{bx}\sin cx + C_{5}e^{bx}\cos cx + C_{6}e^{dx} \).

d. \( y = ( x + C_{1} )^{2}e^{ax} + C_{2}e^{bx} ( \cos cx + \sin cx ) + C_{3}e^{dx} \).

e. I do not know. \\
