What is true about the Fourier transform? \\

a. The Fourier transform can be used to solve difference equations but
not differential equations.

b. The Fourier transform is equivalent to the z-transform in continuous
cases.

c. No parallel between the Fourier transform and the z-transform can be
done in discrete cases.

*d. The Fourier transform is never a nonlinear operation.

e. I do not know \\
