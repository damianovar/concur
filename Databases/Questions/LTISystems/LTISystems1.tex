Consider a system with input-output equation $y^{''}(t)-2y^{'}(t)+2y(t)=x^{'}(t)+x(t)$. What can be said about this system?\\

*a. The system is both linear and time invariant.

b. The system is linear, but not time invariant.

c. The system is not linear, but time invariant.

d. The system is neither linear nor time invariant.

e. I do not know.\\
