% \textbf{Title: Kinematics 3 }

How can we describe kinematic chains? \\

a. It is the connection between kinetic and potential energy in a dynamic system.

*b. Analysing an assembly of rigid bodies, specifying constraints of motion to minimise the degrees of freedom in the system.

c. A chain of rigid bodies connected in such a way that when one moves so does the rest of them. 
 
d. A chain of rigid bodies where all of them are connected to one another but not in such a way that when one moves so does the rest of them.

e. I do not know. \\
