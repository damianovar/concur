Rain starts falling vertically doen into a cart with frictionless wheels which is \textit{initially} moving at a constant velocity on a horizontal surface. The rain drops come to rest with respect to the cart after striking it, and rain accumulates in the cart. Select all of the following statements that must be true about this situation.

I: The cart will continue to move at a constant velocity because the rain is falling vertically while the cart is moving horizontally.
II: The cart will continue to move at a constant velocity because the total mechanical energy in the cart-rain system is conserved.
III: The cart will slow down because the horizontal momentum of the cart-rain system is conserved.\\

a. I

b. II

*c. III

d. I, II

e. I do not know.\\
