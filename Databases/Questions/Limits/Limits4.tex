% \textbf{Title: limit 4}

Let \(f\) be the function defined by
\(f(x)\  = \ sin(x)\  + \ cos(x)\)and let \(g\) be the function defined
by \(g(u)\  = \ \cos(u)\  + \ sin(u)\), for all real numbers
\(x\)and\(u\). Which statement is true.\\

*a. \(f\) and \(g\) are exactly the same functions

b. If \(x\) and \(u\) are different numbers then \(f\) and \(g\) are
different functions

c. not enough information is given to determine if \(f\) and \(g\) are
the same.

d. \(f\) and \(g\) are different functions

e. I do not know.\\
