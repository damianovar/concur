% \textbf{Title: Newton's laws 6}

A kid throws a ball straight up. Consider the motion of the ball only after it has left the kid's hand but before it touches the ground, and assume that forces exerted by the air are negligible. For these conditions, the force or forces acting on the ball are: \\

a. a downward force of gravity along with a steadily decreasing upward force.

b. a steadily decreasing upward force from the moment it leaves the kid's hand until it reaches its highest pint; on the way down there is a steadily increasing downward force of gravity as the ball gets closer to the earth.

c. an almost constant downward force of gravity along with an upward force that steadily decreases until the ball reaches its highest point; on the down there is only a constant downward force of gravity.

d. an almost constant downward force of gravity only.

e. I do not know. \\
