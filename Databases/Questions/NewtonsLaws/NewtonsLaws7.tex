An elevator is lifted up an elevator shaft at a constant speed by a steel cable. All frictional effects are negligible. In this situation, forces on the elevator are such that: \\

a. the upward force by the cable is greater than the downward force of gravity.

*b. the upward force by the cable is equal to the downward force of gravity.

c. the upward force by cable is smaller than the downward force of gravity.

d. the upward force by the cable is greater than the sum of the downward forces of gravity and air.

e. I do not know \\
