% \textbf{Title: Stability 3}

Consider the transfer functions \(H_{1}\left( s \right) = \frac{s + 1}{s^{2} + 4s - 5}\) and \(H_{2}\left( s \right) = \frac{s + 10}{s + 3}\). Which of these system interconnections could be stable? \\

a. A series connection.

b. A parallel connection.

*c. The proportional feedback \(H_{f}\left( s \right) = \frac{H_{1}\left( s \right)}{1 + k \times H_{1}\left( s \right)H_{2}\left( s \right)} = \frac{s + 1}{s^{3} + \left( 7 + k \right)s^{2} + \left( 7 + 11k \right)s + \left( - 15 + 10k \right)}\).

d. None of these connections can become stable.

e. I do not know. \\
