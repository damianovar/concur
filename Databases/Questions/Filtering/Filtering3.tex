% \textbf{Title: Filtering 3}

Consider the first 100 components of the Fourier series of a square wave. For reference, \(b_{n} = \frac{4}{\pi\text{n}}\) for odd \(n\) and zero for even \(n\), where \(b_n\) are the Fourier sine series coefficients. This signal is sent through an ideal filter, which outputs this signal.
