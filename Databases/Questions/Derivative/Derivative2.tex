% \textbf{Title: Derivatives 2}

Which of the following statements is always true for a function \( f(x) \) ?

I. If f(x) and \( g(x) \) are continuous at \( x=a \), then \(\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\) is
continuous at \( x=a \).

II. If \( f(x)+g(x) \) is continuous at \( x=a \) and \( f'(a)=0 \), then \( g(x) \) is
continuous at \( x=a \).

III. If \( f(x)+g(x) \) is differentiable at \( x=a \), then \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are both
differentiable at \( x=a \). \\

a. I only

*b. II only

c. III only

d. I and II
