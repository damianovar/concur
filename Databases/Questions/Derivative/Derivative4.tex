Suppose \( f \) is a function such that \( f'(x) = 4x^{3} \) and \( f''(x) = 12x^{2} \). Which of the following is true?\\

a. \( f \) has a local maximum at \( x= 0 \) by looking at the first derivative

*b. \( f \) has a local minimum at \( x= 0 \) by looking at the first derivative

c. \( f \) has a local maximum at \( x= 0 \) by looking at the second derivative

d. \( f \) has an inflection point at \( x= 0 \)

e. I do not know.\\
