Which of the following statements is always true for a function \( f(x) \) ?

I. If \( f(x) \) is concave up on the interval \( (a,b) \), then \( f(x) \) has a local minimum \( (a,b) \).

II. It is possible for \( y=f(x) \) to have an inflection point at  \( (a,f(a)) \) even if \( f'(x) \) does not exist at \( x=a \).

III. It is possible for \( (a,f(a)) \) to be both a critical point and an inflection point of \( f(x) \).\\

a. I and II

b. III only

c. I, II, and III

*d. II and III

e. I do not know.\\
