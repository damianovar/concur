Suppose that \( f \) is continuous on \( [ a,b ] \) and differentiable on \( (a,b) \). If \( f'(x) > 0 \) on \( (a,b) \). Which of the following is necessarily true?\\

a. \( f \) is decreasing on \( [ a,b ] \)

*b. \( f \) has no local extrema on \( (a,b) \)

c. \( f \) is a constant function on \( (a,b) \)

d. \( f \) is concave up on \( (a,b) \)

e. I do not know.\\
