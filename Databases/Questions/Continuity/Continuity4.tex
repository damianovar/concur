% \textbf{Title: Continuity 4}

Let \(f:]1,5[ \mapsto \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function such that \(f(2) = 3\) and \(f(4) = 6\). The
most we can say about the set \(f(]1,5[)\) is that,\\

a. It is a bounded interval which contains {[}3,6{]}.

*b. It is an interval which contains {[}3,6{]}.

c. It is a set which contains both 3 and 6.

d. It is a bounded set which contains {[}3,6{]}.

e. I do not know.\\
