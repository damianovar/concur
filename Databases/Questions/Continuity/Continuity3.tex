% \textbf{Title: Continuity 3}

Let \(f: [2,4] \mapsto \mathbb{R}\) be a continuous function such that 
\(f(2) = 3\) and \(f(4) = 6\). The most we can say about the set \(f([2,4])\)
is that,\\

*a. It is a closed interval which contains \([3,6]\).

b. It is a set which contains \([3,6]\).

c. It is a closed interval.

d. It is a set which contains 3 and 6.

e. I do not know.\\
