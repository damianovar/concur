What can be said about reactive power in DC-systems?\\

*a. In DC, voltage and current are always in phase. Therefore there is no reactive power.

b. There is only reactive power in DC-systems, because voltage and current always have +90° phase.

c. There is only reactive power in DC-systems, because voltage and current always have -90° phase.

d. As long as there are capacitors and inductors in the circuits, there will be reactive power.

e. I do not know.\\
