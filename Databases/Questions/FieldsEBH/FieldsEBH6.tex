% \textbf{Title: Fields 6}

The parts of transformers, generators and motors where the magnetic
field varies, are often built with multiple stacked sheets of metal.
This is done to reduce the losses that come from eddy currents. Why does
this reduce these losses?\\

a. The path of the currents is shortened, which decreases the resistance
which means that \(Ri^2\) decreases.

*b. The induced voltage that drives the currents is dependent of the area
in which it is induced. Smaller area causes smaller currents.

c. The resistance increases when the conductors become smaller, which
leads to smaller currents.

d. It is easier to cool the sheets, compared to a solid body.

e. I do not know.\\
