% \textbf{Title: Fields 11}

Consider an iron core, with relative permeability
\(\mu_i\), with an air gap whose cross-section area is equal to that of the iron
core. What is the relationship between \(B_i\), the field
inside the iron core, and \(B_a\), the field in the air gap? \\

*a. \( B_i = B_a \).

b. \( B_i = \mu_i B_a \).

c. \( \mu_i B_i = B_a \).

d. \( B_i = 0 \).

e. I do not know.\\
