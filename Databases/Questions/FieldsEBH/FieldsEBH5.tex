% \textbf{Title: Fields 5}

Consider a coil with \(N\) turns and cross section area \(A\). The coil is
rotated with rotational speed \(\omega\) on an axis perpendicular to a B-field with magnitude
\(B\). Which of these actions will \emph{not} increase the induced voltage in the coil?\\

a. Increase the rotational speed.

b. Increase the number of turns.

*c. Increase the angle of the rotation axis to the field.

d. Increase the cross section area.

e. I do not know.\\
