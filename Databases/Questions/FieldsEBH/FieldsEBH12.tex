% \textbf{Title: Fields 12}

Consider an iron core, with relative permeability
\(\mu_i\), with an air gap whose cross-sectional area is equal to that of the iron
core. What is the relationship between \(H_i\), the field
inside the iron core, and \(H_a\), the field in the air gap?\\

a. \( H_i = H_a \).

b. \( H_i = \mu_i H_a \).

*c. \( \mu_i H_i = H_a \).

d. \( H_a = 0 \).

e. I do not know.\\
