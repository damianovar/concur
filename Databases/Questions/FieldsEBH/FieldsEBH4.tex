If a constant E-field is applied to a dielectric, what happens with
the dielectric?\\

a. A current starts to flow in the dielectric.

b. The bound charges on the surface of the dielectric will create a
field, inside the dielectric, in the same direction of the applied field.

*c. The bound charges on the surface of the dielectric will create a
field, inside the dielectric, in the opposite direction of the applied
field.

d. Nothing happens with the dielectric.

e. I do not know.\\
