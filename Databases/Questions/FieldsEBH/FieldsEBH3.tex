% \textbf{Title: Fields 3}

Consider two charges, \(q_1\) and \(q_2\), placed at \((3,1,0)\) and \((4,2,1)\), respectively. If \(q_2\) is moved to the origin, how would the path affect the work needed?\\

a. The shortest path would result in the lowest work.

b. The path where \(q_2\) is as close as possible to \(q_1\) would result in the
greatest work.

*c. All paths would give the same result.

d. The longest path would result in the greatest work.

e. I do not know.\\
