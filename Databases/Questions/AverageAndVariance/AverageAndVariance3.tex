% \textbf{Title: Avg and Var 3}

If we have multiple independent measurements \(X\) in a series, where the
series is described as \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}\), which
equation describes the variance of this series?\\

a. \(\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n^{2}}\)

*b. \(\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n^{}}\)

c. \(n\sigma^{2}\)

d. \(n^{2}\sigma^{2}\)

e. I do not know.\\
