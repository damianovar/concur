% \textbf{Title: Sampling 2}

These signals are sampled with sampling frequency $f_{s}$:

$x_{1}\left( t \right) = \cos 2\pi f_{s}t, \qquad x_{2}\left( t \right) = \sin 2\pi f_{s}t$

$ x_{3}\left( t \right) = \cos\pi f_{s}t, \qquad x_{4}\left( t \right) = \sin\pi f_{s}t$

Which signal can then be reconstructed with an ideal low-pass filter with cut-off frequency $f_{c} = 0.75f_{s}$, with sampling starting at $t = 0$? \\

a. $x_{1}(t)$.

%@ Incorrect. This question tests the concept ``Sampling and Aliasing'', which is taught in these courses.

b. $x_{2}(t)$.

%@ Incorrect. This question tests the concept ``Sampling and Aliasing'', which is taught in these courses.

*c. $x_{3}(t)$.

%@ Correct! This question tests the concept ``Sampling and Aliasing'', which is taught in these courses.

d. $x_{4}(t)$.

%@ Incorrect. This question tests the concept ``Sampling and Aliasing'', which is taught in these courses.

e. I do not know. \\

%@ It's okay. This question tests the concept ``Sampling and Aliasing'', which is taught in these courses.
