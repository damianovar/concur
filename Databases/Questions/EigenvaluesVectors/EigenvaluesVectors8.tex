If we perform an eigendecomposition of a matrix A, how is this then written?\\

*a. $A = Q\Lambda Q^{-1}$, where $Q$ is a matrix constructed with the eigenvectors as columns and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as the diagonal values.

b. $A = Q^{-1} \Lambda Q$, where $Q$ is a matrix constructed with the eigenvectors as columns and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as the diagonal values. 

c. $A = \Lambda Q$, where $Q$ is a matrix constructed with the eigenvectors as columns and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as the diagonal values. 

d. $A = Q\Lambda$, where $Q$ is a matrix constructed with the eigenvectors as columns and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues as the diagonal values. 

e. I do not know.\\
