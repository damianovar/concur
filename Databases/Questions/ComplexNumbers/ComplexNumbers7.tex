% \textbf{Title: Complex numbers 7}

We have a complex number \(z^{n}\). How can this be put in polar coordinates?\\

a. \(n(\cos(\phi) + i\sin(\phi))\) , where \(\phi\) is the phase of
the complex number \(z\).

b. \(r(\cos(\phi)+ i\sin(\phi))\), where \(r\) is the magnitude and
\(\phi\) the phase of the complex number \(z\).

*c. \(r^{n}(\cos(n\phi)+i\sin(n\phi))\), where \(r\) is the magnitude
and \(\phi\) the phase of the complex number \(z\).

d. \(r(\cos(n\phi)+i\sin(n\phi))\), where \(r\) is the magnitude and
\(\phi\) the phase of the complex number \(z\).

e. I do not know.\\
