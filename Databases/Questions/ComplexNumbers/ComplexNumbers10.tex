% \textbf{Title: Complex numbers 10}

According to Euler's formula, we can rewrite complex number from
\(z = r{e}^{i\theta}\) into sinusoids. What is the correct sinusiodal form?
\(\theta\) is the phase of \(z\) and \(r\) is its magnitude.\\

*a. \(re^{i\theta} = r(\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))\)

b. \(re^{i\theta} = r(\cos(\theta) - i\sin(\theta))\)

c. \(re^{i\theta} = (\cos(\theta) + i\sin(\theta))\)

d. \(re^{i\theta} = (\cos(\theta) - i\sin(\theta))\)

e. I do not know.\\
