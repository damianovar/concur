% \textbf{Title: Dimensional analysis 9}

We have the function \(\sin(\omega t + \theta)\), what are the dimensions of \(\omega\) and \(\theta\)?\\

a. \(\theta\) is dimensionless and \(\omega\) has the dimension \textsf{T}.

b. \(\theta\) has the dimension \textsf{T} and \(\omega\) is dimensionless.

*c. \(\omega\) has the dimension \(\text{\textsf{T}}^{-1}\) and \(\theta\) is dimensionless.

d. \(\omega\) is dimensionless and \(\theta\) has the dimension \(\text{\textsf{T}}^{- 1}\).

e. I do not know.\\
