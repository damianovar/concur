% \textbf{Title: Maxwell Eq. 5}

If we have a static case where the currents are steady, one side of the Amp√©re's law only considers the electrical current density J (multiplied by a constant). What is the this equal to? \\

a. The curl of the charge density, $ \rho $.

b. The curl of the electrical field, E.

*c. The curl of the magnetic field, B.

d. The curl of the Lorentz force, F.

e. I do not know \\
