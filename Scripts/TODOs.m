- clean the code from the part relative to "tests" and "questions"
- clean the code from different types of CCMs / CFMs
- rename all the CCM into CFM





workflow:
1 clean the code / rename stuff / get familiar with lower level details
2 fix the fields of the CFM object so that it can load the data in the current googlesheet format 
3 make the code run without plotting the graphs
4 go to the graphs (...)


TODO:
modify the
3 - select which CFM you want to analyze
so that it asks which program you want to analyze, and then which course (and says / asks which version you want to analyze)
note: both links and folders structures should be detectable




folder
"Programs"
1 file for each program, each with the structure as below
